Picking an Interpreter
======================

Which Python to use?


2.x vs 3.x
~~~~~~~~~~

**tl;dr**: Python 2.x is the status quo, Python 3.x is the shiny new thing.

Today
-----

If you're choosing a Python interpreter to use, I *highly* recommend you Use Python 2.7.x, unless you have a strong reason not to.


The Future
----------

As more and more modules get ported over to Python3, the easier it will be for
others to use it.


Which Python to Support?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're starting work on a new Python module, I recommend you write it for
Python 2.5 or 2.6, and add support for Python3 in a later iteration.
