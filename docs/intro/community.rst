PEPs
----

PEPs are *Python Enhancement Proposals*. They are define change to Python itself, or the standards around it.

There are three different types of PEPs (as defined by `PEP1 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/>`_):

    **Standards**
        Describes a new feature or implementation.

    **Informational**
        Describes a design issue, general guidelines, or information to the community.

    **Process**
        Describes a process related to Python.


There are a few PEPs that could be considered required reading:

- `PEP8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_: The Python Style Guide. Read this. All of it. Follow it.

- `PEP20 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`_: The Zen of Python. A list of 19 statements that briefly explain the philosophy behind Python.

- `PEP257 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_: Docstring Conventions. Gives guidelines for semantics and conventions associated with Python docstrings.

You can read more at `The PEP Index <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/>`_.

 PEPs are peer-reviewed and accepted/rejected after much discussion. Anyone can write and submit a PEP for review.
